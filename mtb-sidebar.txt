Please be sure to read the sidebar before posting. As much as we love helping each other out, we hate repeating ourselves.

Need helping choosing a bike, finding places to ride, or just want advice on technique, gear, or cycling etiquette? Please post in the *Weekly New Rider Thread*, posted each Monday by /u/mtbot.

Please follow proper [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), and if you haven't already, take a moment to [read our wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/wiki/index) and learn a bit about the [site's history](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5U-NCG1zZds).

* Remember to vote based on quality, not opinion, and keep your submission titles factual and opinion-free.

* Do *not* downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, or mass-downvote someone else's posts. (It's obvious and tacky.)

* Be generous with upvotes. They are free, after all.

* Do not submit screenshots, pictures with superimposed text, or any other photo/video that doesn't help r/mtb grow as a community. This includes image macros, Rage Comics, meme pics, [comments with meme speak](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jelly), and static bike and trail photos.

If you want to submit a photo of your bike or where you ride, submit your link as a text post and include details and context. ([Like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/31nqoh/new_bike_day_commencal_meta_am_v4/).) The general rule is photo and video submissions to /r/mtb should be of people *riding* mountain bikes.

As is the policy for all Reddit communities, blogspam is forbidden. (Ditto for craigslist ads.) And go easy with the links to PinkBike and Vital. If a video has a few thousand views, chances are we've all already seen it.

If you think your post was removed by mistake, use the [*message the moderators*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMTB) link in the sidebar and include a link to your post. (Otherwise we'll ignore it. We are busy, after all.)
